              SSL, or Secure Sockets Layer, is a communications protocol that 
              creates a secure, private, encrypted connection between you and 
              the website you visit. There is a 'handshake' between the website 
              and your computer to verify and authenticate each side. Then, it 
              encrypts the connection so no one else can see what's going on. 
              This allows sensitive information, such as credit card details 
              or payments, to be sent safely over the internet.

          <div class="text">
            <p>
              TLS, or Transport Layer Security, is actually a replacement for SSL. 
              The two terms are so closely related that they are often used 
              interchangeably. The main difference is that TLS does more, such as 
              encrypting other communications like email, messages, and voice. 
              On top of that, TLS is more secure and kept up to date.

              <p>
                There are two ways to verify that a website is secure. First, 
                look at the top of your browser, where the address bar is. 
                There should be a lock icon somewhere. Every browser shows this 
                a little differently, but it should be there. You can click on 
                this lock to verify its authenticity. Second, check the URL of 
                the page you are visiting. Before the 'www.', you should see 
                'HTTPS://' instead of 'HTTP://'. If both of these are present, 
                the website you're visiting should be secure.

          <div class="container flex flex-between secure-2">
            <div class="question">
              <h3>What does "secure" mean anyways?</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="text">
              <p>
                By basic definition of the word, it means for things to be safe. In
                terms of browser security, it means that any information that you
                input is hidden and goes exactly where it supposed to, so that you 
                don't have to worry about it being stolen.

        <div id="encription" class="container flex flex-between">
          <div class="question">
            <h3>What is encryption anyways and why should I care?</h3>
          </div>
          <div class="text">
            <p>
              Encryption converts information into a code, making it hard to 
              read unless you have the right key to decrypt it. It locks the 
              information so that only the designated system can open it. If 
              sensitive information isn't encrypted before sending, anyone 
              could see it. Encrypting this information is important to 
              prevent your private, valuable details from being stolen in transit. 
              Imagine writing your credit card information on a piece of paper 
              and throwing it in the air. That's what it would be like 
              if it wasn't encrypted.

              Does it matter if HTTP or HTTPS are used when talking 
              about secure sites?
            </h3>
          </div>
          <div class="text">
            <p>
              The prefix in every website URL indicates whether or not it is 
              secure. The 'S' at the end of 'HTTP' stands for 'secure,' 
              so if it is not present, the website you are visiting is not secure. 
              You cannot simply add an 'S' to 'HTTP' to make a website secure. 
              A different connection is needed from the server to make it secure.

          <div class="text">
            <p>
              A certificate authority (CA) is a company that issues SSL 
              certificates, allowing you to secure your website. 
              This certificate provides authentication, encryption, and integrity. 
              It lets people visiting your website know that you are secure and 
              can be trusted with sensitive information.
